            <h3>Chicken Riggies</h3>
            <p>History of Chicken Riggies
              Well there are many stories of how Chicken Riggies was invented. But they all 
              seem to start with the Clinton House in Clinton NY. The story says that in 1979, 
              on Monday nights, the lawyers, doctors and union workers would come in to play 
              cards and the chefs would make this dish for them.
              So over the years many restaurants would make their own variation of it but 
              he most notable one is Chesterfield’s Restaurant in Utica. They have been
              making it since 1989. If you are looking to try Chicken Riggies, there is

              In a large pot melt butter and then add chicken.
              Cook chicken over medium heat just until they begin to turn white.<br>
              Add mushrooms to chicken and cook for 5 minutes.<br>
              Add peppers and onions cook 5-7 minutes (I usually season the veggies and chicken with salt and pepper at this point).<br>

                The story of the Half Moon cookie
                
                Round chocolate cookie that is frosted half chocolate and half vanilla. 
                Originated in the early 20th century by Hemstroughts bakery. 
                Where there are some versions in NYC but it is a glazed hard cookie 
                not a frosted soft cookie. The original Half moon cookie had a chocolate 
                drop cookie bottom with half chocolate frosting and half vanilla frosting. 
                Now, different bakeries in the Utica area have different varieties of the 
                cookie from vanilla bottom, carrot cake bottom , peanut butter frosted, red 
                velvet bottom. The possibilities are endless. The best places to buy these are 
                Hemstroughts bakery in your local grocery stores, Holland Farms in Yorkville Gingerbread Bake shop 
                in Washington Mills( my favorite) The owner at of the Gingerbread bake shop once worked for 
                Hemstroughts and when Hemstroughts went out of business Jerry Hoban opened the Gingerbread 
                bake shop and took the recipe with him and changed it a bit to make it his own.</p>

                <h3>Utica Greens</h3>
              <p>Utica greens was made popular by the owner of Chesterfield’s restaurant in Utica NY. Joe Morelle was the owner and chef. He observed a chef who worked at Grimaldi’s restaurant, one time in 1988, when Morelle was an employee there. He adjusted the recipe and a hit was made. When Chesterfield’s restaurant opened, it was served as an appetizer on the menu.
                  This is an old-time dish made by ancestors from Italy. It is seen at home tables of just greens or called “scrole”, garlic and olive oil. Then things were added to make it a better dish by adding things like hot peppers, breadcrumbs, proscitto, potatoes and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese making it an amazing dish.
                  There are many variations of the famous dish, but Morelle’s version is the most well-known.</p>

                <h3>Tomato Pie</h3>
              <p>In the early 1900’s the Italian-American pie make it debut. No one really knows where it started but O’Scugnizzo’s Pizza on Bleeker St started to sell it in 1914, and Napolis bakery in Utica has been making it for more than 50 years. 
                Its thick light focaccia like dough that is lathered in tomato sauce and adding Pecorino Romano cheese and oregano makes this pie incredible. You don’t want to serve this hot or refrigerated. Room temperature is best. You also never have to worry about it going bad because it is gone before it can. 
                It is amazing dish that I have loved since I was a kid. When ever there is a party or a get together of some sort. You always see a tomato pie.
