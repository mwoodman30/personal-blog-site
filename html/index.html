                <p>History of Chicken Riggies
                    Well there are many stories of how Chicken Riggies was invented. But they all seem 
                    to start with the Clinton House in Clinton NY. The story says that in 1979, on Monday 
                    nights, the lawyers, doctors and union workers would come in to play cards and the 
                    chefs would make this dish for them. So over the years many restaurants would 
                    make their own variation of it but the most notable one is Chesterfieldâ€™s 
                    Restaurant in Utica. They have been making it since 1989.

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
                of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
