                    <h3>Tomato Pie</h3>
              <p>In the early 1900’s the Italian-American pie make it debut. No one really knows where it started but O’Scugnizzo’s Pizza on Bleeker St started to sell it in 1914, and Napolis bakery in Utica has been making it for more than 50 years. 
                Its thick light focaccia like dough that is lathered in tomato sauce and adding Pecorino Romano cheese and oregano makes this pie incredible. You don’t want to serve this hot or refrigerated. Room temperature is best. You also never have to worry about it going bad because it is gone before it can. 
                It is amazing dish that I have loved since I was a kid. When ever there is a party or a get together of some sort. You always see a tomato pie. For an easy recipe for Tomato Pie try the one below.
                Recipe<br>
                <br>
                 
                Tomato Pie Recipe<br>
                3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil<br>
                
                
                2 cloves garlic<br>
                1 28-to-32-oz. can crushed tomatoes<br>
                1 tsp. dried oregano<br>
                salt and pepper to taste<br>
                1 lb. pizza dough<br>
                3 tbsp. grated Pecorino Romano cheese<br>
                 
                Preheat oven to 450°F. Stretch the pizza dough to cover a greased cookie sheet. Dough should be fairly 
                thick (about 3/4 inch). Allow the dough to rise a bit while the sauce is cooking. Heat a saucepan on medium, 
                add the olive oil and garlic, and sauté until the garlic is just golden. Add crushed tomatoes and oregano. 
                Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 15-20 minutes. Cool the sauce to room temperature. Top the pizza dough
                 with the sauce and then bake in 450°F oven for about 15-20 minutes. After removing the pie from the oven, sprinkle
                  with the cheese. Let the pie cool to room temperature before eating.</p>

              <h3>Halfmoons</h3>
              <p> Round chocolate cookie that is frosted half chocolate and half vanilla. 
                Originated in the early 20th century by Hemstroughts bakery. Where there 
                are some versions in NYC but it is a glazed hard cookie not a frosted soft 
                cookie. The original Half moon cookie had a chocolate drop cookie bottom 
                with half chocolate frosting and half vanilla frosting. Now, different 
                bakeries in the Utica area have different varieties of the cookie from 
                vanilla bottom, carrot cake bottom , peanut butter frosted, red velvet bottom. 
                The possibilities are endless. The best places to buy these are Hemstroughts
                bakery in your local grocery stores, Holland Farms in Yorkville, Gingerbread 
                Bake shop in Washington Mills( my favorite) The owner at of the Gingerbread 
                bake shop once worked for Hemstroughts and when Hemstroughts went out of business 
                Jerry Hoban opened the Gingerbread bake shop and took the recipe with him and 
                changed it a bit to make it his own.</p>

                <h3>Utica Greens</h3>
              <p>Utica greens was made popular by the owner of Chesterfield’s restaurant in Utica NY. Joe
                 Morelle was the owner and chef. He observed a chef who worked at Grimaldi’s restaurant, 
                 one time in 1988, when Morelle was an employee there. He adjusted the recipe and a hit
                  was made. When Chesterfield’s restaurant opened, it was served as an appetizer on the menu.
                This is an old-time dish made by ancestors from Italy. It is seen at home tables of just 
                greens or called “scrole”, garlic and olive oil. Then things were added to make it a better 
                dish by adding things like hot peppers, breadcrumbs, proscitto, potatoes and P
                armigiano-Reggiano cheese making it an amazing dish.</p>

                <h2>Chicken Riggies</h2>
                    <p>History of Chicken Riggies
                      Well there are many stories of how Chicken Riggies was invented. But they all 
                      eem to start with the Clinton House in Clinton NY. The story says that in 1979, 
                      on Monday nights, the lawyers, doctors and union workers would come in to play 
                      cards and the chefs would make this dish for them.
                      So over the years many restaurants would make their own variation of it but 
                      the most notable one is Chesterfield’s Restaurant in Utica. They have been
                       making it since 1989. <br>
