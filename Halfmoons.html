            <h3>Halfmoons</h3>                        
                <p>Round chocolate cookie that is frosted half chocolate 
                and half vanilla. Originated in the early 20th century by Hemstroughts bakery. 
                Where there are some versions in NYC but it is a glazed hard cookie not a frosted 
                soft cookie. The original Half moon cookie had a chocolate drop cookie bottom with 
                half chocolate frosting and half vanilla frosting. Now, different bakeries in the 
                Utica area have different varieties of the cookie from vanilla bottom, carrot cake 
                bottom , peanut butter frosted, red velvet bottom. The possibilities are endless. The
                 best places to buy these are Hemstroughts bakery in your local grocery stores, Holland 
                 Farms in Yorkville Gingerbread Bake shop in Washington Mills( my favorite) The owner 
                 at of the Gingerbread bake shop once worked for Hemstroughts and when Hemstroughts went 
                 out of business Jerry Hoban opened the Gingerbread bake shop and took the recipe with him 
                 and changed it a bit to make it his own.. Below is the famous recipe for the Hemstroughts 
                 Bakery cookie.<br>

            <h2>Chicken Riggies</h2>
              <p>History of Chicken Riggies
                Well there are many stories of how Chicken Riggies was invented. But they all 
                eem to start with the Clinton House in Clinton NY. The story says that in 1979, 
                on Monday nights, the lawyers, doctors and union workers would come in to play 
                cards and the chefs would make this dish for them.
                So over the years many restaurants would make their own variation of it but 
                the most notable one is Chesterfield’s Restaurant in Utica. They have been
                 making it since 1989.</p>

                <h3>Utica Greens</h3>
              <p>Utica greens was made popular by the owner of Chesterfield’s restaurant in Utica NY. Joe Morelle was the 
                owner and chef. He observed a chef who worked at Grimaldi’s restaurant, one time in 1988, when Morelle was a
                n employee there. He adjusted the recipe and a hit was made. When Chesterfield’s restaurant opened, it was 
                served as an appetizer on the menu. This is an old-time dish made by ancestors from Italy. It is seen at 
                home tables of just greens or called “scrole”, garlic and olive oil. Then things were added to make it 
                a better dish by adding things like hot peppers, breadcrumbs, proscitto, potatoes and Parmigiano-Reggiano 
                cheese making it an amazing dish. There are many variations of the famous dish, but Morelle’s version is the 
                most well-known.</p>

                <h3>Tomato Pie</h3>
              <p>In the early 1900’s the Italian-American pie make it debut. No one really knows where it 
                started but O’Scugnizzo’s Pizza on Bleeker St started to sell it in 1914, and Napolis 
                bakery in Utica has been making it for more than 50 years. Its thick light focaccia 
                like dough that is lathered in tomato sauce and adding Pecorino Romano cheese and oregano 
                makes this pie incredible. You don’t want to serve this hot or refrigerated. Room temperature 
                st. You also never have to worry about it going bad because it is gone before it can. 
                It is amazing dish that I have loved since I was a kid. When ever there is a party or a get 
                together of some sort. You always see a tomato pie.
